							Desi currently works for Dragos and believes in the mission to protect civilisation. He is also a podcast host, educator, student, mentor, ctf player & designer.</p>
							<p>
							All his spare time is taken up by fitness, gaming, and of course his dogs.	
							</p>
						</td>
					</tr>

						<td><img class="team" src="images/image/moxie.jpeg"></td>
						<td>
							<p>
								Moxie loves humans and will always take out your shins for a pat. She is on the fence about soft toys but is a firm believer that squeakers and stuffing are meant to be on the outside. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Has a severe reaction to the site of cats... maybe she thinks they're soft toys?
							</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><img class="team" src="images/image/waffle.JPG"></td>
						<td>
							<p>
								Waffle loves attention once she's gotten to know you. Will always bark at men (except for desi) unless you have food. 
							</p>
							<p>
								She has an eye condition so at night her pupils point in different directions and she looks like Pennywise.
